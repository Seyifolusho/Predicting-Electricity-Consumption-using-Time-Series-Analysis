# Predicting-Electricity-Consumption-using-Time-Series-Analysis


## **Introduction**  
Electricity consumption forecasting is a cornerstone of modern energy management. Accurately predicting energy usage allows utilities and policymakers to optimize grid operations, allocate resources efficiently, and ensure the sustainable utilization of energy. This project is a step toward achieving those goals by leveraging historical electricity consumption data to build a predictive model using time series analysis techniques.  

Through this project, I set out to identify trends, seasonality, and residual components in the data to better understand electricity demand. Using this understanding, I developed a forecasting model that provides actionable insights for improving energy planning and management. The ability to predict future consumption with confidence intervals not only aids in operational decision-making but also ensures a balanced and reliable energy supply in the face of increasing demand and evolving consumption patterns.

## **Problem Statement**  
The energy sector faces numerous challenges, many of which stem from the uncertainty in electricity demand. This uncertainty often leads to inefficiencies that have far-reaching consequences. For instance:  
- **Demand Prediction:** Misjudging electricity demand can result in either overproduction, which wastes resources, or underproduction, which risks outages.  
- **Resource Allocation:** Inaccurate predictions make it challenging to allocate energy efficiently, causing financial losses and operational disruptions.  
- **Seasonality and Trends:** Seasonal peaks, such as increased demand during extreme weather, and long-term growth trends must be accurately captured for effective grid stability and future planning.  

To address these issues, this project takes a data-driven approach to:  
1. Identify historical patterns and seasonal trends in electricity consumption.  
2. Build a robust forecasting model using ARIMA that provides reliable future predictions.  
3. Provide insights and recommendations that can guide energy providers in efficient grid management and resource planning.

## **Methodology**  

To achieve the project’s objectives, I followed a structured and iterative workflow, which included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), stationarity testing, model development, and forecasting.  

### **Data Preprocessing**  

#### **Dataset Details**  
The dataset used for this project, `Electric_Production.csv`, contains two key columns:  
- **Date:** A timestamp indicating when each observation was recorded.  
- **Consumption:** The measured electricity consumption in megawatts.  

#### **Data Cleaning**  
The raw data required careful preprocessing to ensure it was suitable for time series analysis. This included:  
1. Removing any null or missing values to preserve data integrity.  
2. Converting the "Date" column into a proper datetime format for easier manipulation and time series indexing.  
3. Setting the "Date" column as the index to facilitate plotting, transformations, and analysis.  

#### **Initial Visualization**  
To understand the dataset, I plotted the raw data as a line graph. This revealed:  
- An **upward trend** in electricity consumption over time, indicative of growing demand.  
- Seasonal spikes at regular intervals, suggesting repeated patterns of high consumption.  
- Potential anomalies that warranted further investigation.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  

EDA provided an opportunity to dive deeper into the data and extract meaningful insights.  

1. **Line Plots:**  
   A visual representation of electricity consumption over time highlighted an overall increasing trend.  

2. **Scatter Plots:**  
   Scatter plots helped visualize variability in the data, revealing periods of higher or lower dispersion.  

3. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE):**  
   A KDE plot was generated to examine the distribution of consumption values. The near-normal distribution suggested that electricity consumption is relatively stable but with notable deviations during seasonal peaks.

### **Stationarity Testing**  

#### **Why Stationarity Matters**  
For time series forecasting, a stationary series—where mean and variance remain constant over time—is crucial. Stationary data ensures that patterns are predictable and modeling assumptions are valid.  

#### **Rolling Statistics**  
I calculated and plotted the rolling mean and standard deviation to visually assess trends. The presence of a clear upward trend indicated non-stationarity.  

#### **Dickey-Fuller Test**  
To statistically verify stationarity, I conducted the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Initial results confirmed that the data was non-stationary, necessitating transformations.

### **Data Transformation**  

To stabilize the series, I applied the following transformations:  
1. **Log Transformation:**  
   This reduced the impact of large fluctuations and stabilized variance.  
2. **Moving Average:**  
   By computing and subtracting the rolling mean from the original series, I removed the long-term trend.  
3. **Differencing:**  
   Subtracting lagged values from the series eliminated seasonal patterns.  

Re-applying the ADF test after these transformations confirmed that the data was now stationary, making it suitable for modeling.  

---

### **Decomposition**  

To better understand the underlying components of the series, I decomposed it into:  
- **Trend:** A steady increase in electricity demand over time.  
- **Seasonality:** Regular patterns of high and low consumption, likely driven by weather and human activities.  
- **Residuals:** Random noise with no discernible pattern, which were stationary.  

This decomposition helped isolate the components that the ARIMA model would need to account for during forecasting.

### **Model Development**  

#### **ACF and PACF Analysis**  
Autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots were instrumental in identifying the dependencies between current and past values. These plots guided the selection of ARIMA parameters:  
- **p (autoregressive terms):** Determined from PACF.  
- **q (moving average terms):** Determined from ACF.  
- **d (differencing):** Determined during stationarity testing.  

#### **ARIMA Model**  
Using the insights from ACF and PACF, I built an ARIMA(3,1,3) model that effectively captured temporal patterns in the data.  

#### **Model Training and Evaluation**  
- Trained the model on the transformed dataset.  
- Evaluated performance using Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), which was low, indicating a good fit.  
- Compared predicted vs. actual values through visualizations to ensure accuracy.

### **Forecasting**  

The ARIMA model was used to forecast electricity consumption for the next 4 months.  
- **Future Predictions:**  
   Generated predictions along with confidence intervals to account for uncertainty.  
- **Visualization:**  
   Plotted actual vs. forecasted values, highlighting the forecasted range with confidence intervals.

## **Insights and Results**  

1. **Seasonal Trends:**  
   Consumption spiked annually, with notable increases during extreme weather months, indicating heating and cooling demands.  

2. **Long-Term Growth:**  
   The steady upward trend in electricity demand reflects population growth and greater energy dependence.  

3. **Model Accuracy:**  
   The ARIMA(3,1,3) model accurately captured temporal patterns, with predictions closely aligning with observed data.

## **Recommendations**  

1. **Operational Strategies:**  
   - Use predictions to optimize resource allocation during high-demand seasons.  
   - Schedule grid maintenance during forecasted low-demand periods to minimize disruptions.  

2. **Model Enhancements:**  
   - Incorporate external variables, such as weather data and economic indicators, to improve forecasting precision.  
   - Explore hybrid models combining ARIMA with machine learning techniques like LSTM for greater accuracy.  

3. **Scalability:**  
   - Deploy the model in a production environment to enable real-time forecasting and continuous monitoring.

## **Conclusion**  

This project demonstrates the power of time series analysis for forecasting electricity consumption. By transforming the data into a stationary series, decomposing trends and seasonality, and applying ARIMA modeling, I was able to achieve accurate and actionable predictions.  

These insights are invaluable for energy providers and policymakers, helping them plan more effectively, optimize grid operations, and ensure the sustainability of resources. Future work will focus on enhancing the model by integrating additional datasets and exploring advanced hybrid approaches for forecasting.
